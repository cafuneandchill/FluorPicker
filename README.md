# FluorPicker
This simple script will be able to determine the right filter cubes for a fluorescent microscope to perform experiments with the fluorescent dyes of your choice.

The script considers a filter cube fitting for observing a certain dye if the dye's excitation and emission wavelengths are in the wavelength range of cube's excitation and suppression parameters, respectively. The script also checks whether the fuorescent dye's excitation and emission wavelengths are separated by cube's dichroic mirror (beam splitter) cutoff wavelength.
